        <p>I spent three years learning one language, and it took me one summer
          to learn three languages. Coding has brought me so much joy and also
          frustration. Frustration as in taking 2 hours to find the bug behind
          my picture not being centered and it turns out I was missing a colon: one. single. colon. </p>

        <p> This website that you’ve been looking through was completely coded by
          me. What better way to express all of my summer than to put everything I
          learned into a website I coded myself. Now that I’ve returned home I have
          continued coding and hope to design more websites of my own. </p>

        <p> Thank you for reading. I hope you enjoyed learning about my Zume Summer! </p>
